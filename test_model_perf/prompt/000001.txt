This is a real-life video of speech. The person's details must be clearly visible, especially the lip area; the camera must be fixed and must not rotate or move around the person; the person should preferably look at the camera. A female astrophysicist in a lab coat explains a complex theory in her laboratory, framed in a medium close-up. She uses a pen to point to a diagram just out of frame. Her lips move clearly with each word, and the fixed camera captures her steadily from a frontal angle, with a simple backdrop of a whiteboard with equations behind her.
