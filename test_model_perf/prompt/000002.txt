This is a green screen video. The background must be a completely uniform, unblemished, pure chroma key green with perfectly even brightness and absolutely no patterns, textures, gradients, or any other visual elements whatsoever. The person is the aonly visible element in the entire frame, with no exceptions. The subject is a pensive German man in his 40s, wearing a simple grey V-neck sweater. He is speaking thoughtfully to the camera, often touching his chin with his hand in a contemplative gesture. The shot is a crystal-clear medium close-up shot, framed to show the entire head and neck. The video is shot in a standard 16:9 landscape aspect ratio with sharp 480p resolution.
