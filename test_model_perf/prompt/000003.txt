This is a green screen video. The background must be a completely uniform, unblemished, pure chroma key green with perfectly even brightness and absolutely no patterns, textures, gradients, or any other visual elements whatsoever. The subject is a middle-aged Caucasian man with short, graying hair, speaking earnestly to the camera. The shot must be framed exactly like a standard American yearbook photograph. Imagine a blue or grey backdrop behind him instead of green; the composition must be identical to that style. This means the subject is looking directly forward, is perfectly centered, there is obvious empty space above his head, and the shot is cropped just below his neck, showing no shoulders. The entire head and hair are fully intact. The video is shot in a standard 16:9 landscape aspect ratio with sharp 480p resolution.
