The video shows a young man with short dark hair and glasses, wearing a dark shirt. He is seated outdoors, speaking directly to the camera. His facial expressions and mouth movements indicate he is talking, with occasional head tilts and slight shifts in gaze. His right hand is visible in some frames, gesturing as he speaks. The background features a calm body of water, tall reeds, and distant buildings under a partly cloudy sky. The scene appears to be in a park or lakeside area with natural vegetation. Subtitles in Chinese appear at the bottom of the screen, indicating he is discussing query methods for journal partitioning.
