The video sequence shows a woman in a bedroom, applying makeup while holding a pink heart-shaped mirror. She has her hair styled in rollers and is wearing a pink and white striped robe. She uses a small brush to apply makeup to her eye area, focusing intently on her reflection. Her hands are adorned with rings and a bracelet, and she has a tattoo on her left wrist. The background includes a bed with white bedding and a wall-mounted photo collage, illuminated by soft lighting. The scene remains consistent throughout the frames, with minimal movement aside from her hand motions as she applies makeup.
